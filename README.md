# Topologically Attributed Graphs

This is code to reproduce some of the examples in our paper "Topologically Attributed Graphs for Shape Discrimination", by Justin Curry, Washington Mio, Tom Needham, Osman Berat Okutan, and Florian Russold.

The paper will appear in the ICML workshop "Topology, Algebra and Geometry in Machine Learning (TAG-ML)", 2023. It can be found on the arxiv here:

The Jupyter notebooks in this repository can be used to reproduce most of the computational results found in Section 6 of the paper.
